Git and GitHub
---------------
What is Git?
	-> Git is a free and open source version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
	-> Version control - is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
	
Git vs GitHub
--------------	
	-> Git is version control system.
	-> GitHub is a site that provides hosting for our repositories and tools to work with them.	
	-> So, even BitBucket, GitBucket are also similar to GitHub.
	
	Download git from https://git-scm.com/.
	
	Once installed, to configure it in VS Code:
	--------------------------------------------
		--> Open View -> Terminal or Ctrl+` (back tick)
		--> you can select the Git bash here as the terminal. We can also have it set to default.
		--> To check the git version -> git --version or git -v.
		--> clear to clear the terminal (this is not a git command).
		--> To configure git globally
				--> git config --global user.name "Gowthaman Jeganathan"
				--> git config --global user.email "Gowthamnhub@gmail.com"
			To check the user name / email:
				--> git config user.name
				--> git config user.email
				
		To clone a repo from GitHub to local folder:
			-> git clone https://github.com/gowthamnhub/Advanced-CSharp.git (example).
			
		Created a repository in GitHub - "learn-git-github"	
		Cloned to GitHub folder in local system	
			git clone "https://github.com/gowthamnhub/learn-git-github.git"
		
		Added this file "Learn_Git_GitHub.txt" to the folder "learn-git-github"
		Now I can see there is one change showing in Source Control menu as untracked file.

		We can also view the status of the folder using below;	
			
		go to repo folder in VS Code terminal - 
		--> cd learn-git-github
		--> git status
			
		What is known as untracked? what is happening here? 	
			Basically when we clone a repo to our local folder -> it will have two sections,
				--> git copy folder (which does exist in GitHub)
				--> another is git working copy (which we have not moved yet, or in progress one).
				
			So we need to move the working copy to git copy folder --> then push it to GitHub.
			To make the file status to untracked to tracked, we have to add the file to git.
				--> git add "Learn_Git_GitHub.txt"
				
			Once it is added, it is like its in the staging area, to make it move to the git copy folder, we need to commit.
				--> git commit -m "about git and git hub initial notes from Error Makes Clever Channel"
				
			So, now local git copy is updated with working copy changes.
			But GitHub repo is still not updated, for that we have to push the changes.
				--> git push origin main --> origin (GitHub Repo in this case "learn-git-github")
